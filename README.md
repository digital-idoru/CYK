# CYK
CYK Algorithm for solving the membership problem of CFGs. Currently only supports CFGs presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Future updates will include support for converting any given CFG into an equivalent CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. 
The algorithm checks if given an input string w \in \Sigma^* that it can be generated from the given grammar. This algorithm is supposed to run in O(n^3) time.
